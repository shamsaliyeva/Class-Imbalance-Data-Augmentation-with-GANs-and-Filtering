# Tabular-Data-Synthesis-with-GANs-and-Filtering
This repository explores combining and filtering synthetic tabular data from different Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to improve classifier performance. Specifically, it investigates leveraging CTGAN and WGAN-GP generative models together. A unique filtering method is used to prioritize data points that reduce error rates for minority classes.
